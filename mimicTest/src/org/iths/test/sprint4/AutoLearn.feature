Feature: As a Tester I would like the mock to learn how to respond 
				to requests that I have not defined so that I do not 
        have to create code for that manually (only add, mult, sub and div)
@AutoLearn111
  Scenario Outline: Learn how to calculate add, sub, mult and div with one digit values
    Given that the mimicService is running
    When I teach the mock that <questionOne> has response <responseOne>
    And I teach the mock that <questionTwo> has response <responseTwo>
    Then <notKnownQuestion> respondes with <notKnownResponse>
    
    Examples:
    	|       questionOne       | responseOne |       questionTwo          | responseTwo |     notKnownQuestion       | notKnownResponse |
 			| "add?value1=1&value2=1" |    "2"      |   "add?value1=1&value2=2"  |     "3"     |  "add?value1=1&value2=3"   |       "4"        |
 			|"sub?value1=5&value2=1"  |    "4"      |   "sub?value1=5&value2=2"  |     "3"     |  "sub?value1=5&value2=3"   |       "2"        |
 			|"mult?value1=3&value2=2" |    "6"      |  "mult?value1=3&value2=3"  |     "9"     |  "mult?value1=3&value2=4"  |       "12"       |
 			|"div?value1=4&value2=2"  |    "2"      |  "div?value1=60&value2=20" |     "3"     |  "div?value1=8&value2=4"   |       "2"        |

  Scenario Outline: Learn how to calculate add with multiple digit values
    Given that the mimicService is running
    When I teach the mock that <questionOne> has response <responseOne>
    And I teach the mock that <questionTwo> has response <responseTwo>
    Then <notKnownQuestion> respondes with <notKnownResponse>
    
    Examples:
    	|       questionOne         | responseOne  |       questionTwo            | responseTwo  |     notKnownQuestion       | notKnownResponse |
 			|"add?value1=10&value2=20"  |    "30"      | "add?value1=20&value2=20"    |     "40"     |  "add?value1=1&value2=2"   |       "3"        |
 			|"add?value1=111&value2=111"|    "222"     | "add?value1=222&value2=222"  |     "444"    |  "add?value1=1&value2=1"   |       "1"        |
 	
 	#Try to end test case when not completing		
  #@AutoLearn113
	#Scenario: Calling with format "x?y"
	#	Given that the mimicService is running
	 # When I make the request "test?ett"
	 # Then "test?ett" returns the response form

  Scenario: Learn how to calculate add while alternating with mult
    Given that the mimicService is running
    When I teach the mock that "add?value1=1&value2=2" has response "3" 
    And I teach the mock that "mult?value1=3&value2=2" has response "6"
    And I teach the mock that "add?value1=1&value2=1" has response "2"
    Then "add?value1=1&value2=3" respondes with "4"
    
  @AutoLearn115
  Scenario: UnlearnAll removes all learned formats
    Given that the mimicService is running
    And that the mock has learned "add?value1=1&value2=2" with "3" 
    And that the mock has learned "add?value1=1&value2=1" with "2"
    And "add?value1=1&value2=3" respondes with "4"
    When I write unlearnAll in url
		Then "add?value1=1&value2=3" returns the response form

  Scenario: Terminating Mimic does not remove learned formats
    Given that the mimicService is running
    And that the mock has learned "add?value1=1&value2=2" with "3" 
    And that the mock has learned "add?value1=1&value2=1" with "2"
    And "add?value1=1&value2=3" respondes with "4"
    When I terminate the mimicService
    And I start mimicService
		Then "add?value1=1&value2=3" respondes with "4"

  Scenario: Correcting a request does not affect learned formats
    Given that the mimicService is running
    And that the mock has learned "add?value1=10&value2=20" with "30" 
    And that the mock has learned "add?value1=20&value2=20" with "40"
    And "add?value1=1&value2=3" does not responde with "4"
    When I teach the mock that "add?value1=1&value2=3" has response "4"
		Then "add?value1=15&value2=5" respondes with "20"
