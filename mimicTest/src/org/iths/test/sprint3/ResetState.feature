
Feature: As a Tester I would like to reset the state so that I can run a complete test scenario

 @resetState111
  Scenario Outline: Reset with one state in the request
    Given that the mimicService is running
    And that the mock has learned <question> with <response>
    When I call resetState 
    Then <question> respondes with <response>
    
     Examples:
      | question| response | 
      | "1+1"   |   "2"    |
   
   
     
@resetState112
  Scenario Outline: Reset with multiple state in the request
    Given that the mimicService is running
    And that the mock has learned <questionOne> with <responseOne>
    And that the mock has learned <questionOne> with <responseTwo>
    And that the mock has learned <questionOne> with <responseThree>
    When I call resetState
    Then <questionOne> respondes with <responseOne>
    
     Examples:
      | questionOne| responseOne | responseTwo |responseThree| 
      | "1+1"      |     "2"     | "4"         |   "6"       |
   
   
  @resetState113   
  Scenario Outline: Reset with multiple state with same response in the request
    Given that the mimicService is running
     And that the mock has learned <questionOne> with <responseOne>
    And that the mock has learned <questionOne> with <responseTwo>
    And that the mock has learned <questionOne> with <responseOne>
    When I call resetState
    Then <questionOne> respondes with <responseOne>
    
     Examples:
      | questionOne| responseOne | responseTwo |
      | "1+1"      |     "2"     | "4"         |
