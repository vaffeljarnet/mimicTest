  @StoreInBrainFile111
  Scenario Outline: Store one request and make same request after reboot
    Given that the mimicService is running
    And that no requests are stored
    When I teach the mock that <question> has response <response>
    And I terminate the mimicService
    And I start mimicService
    Then <question> respondes with <response>
